            Hello and Welcome to the section of the website where you get to learn a little bit about me! I am a recent graduate of Ryerson
            University with a degree in biology although if I am being honest was not something I enjoyed at all. I even
            undertook a thesis project in my final year to give research a shot however that also was not something I saw
            myself doing in the future. The way I came across programming was through a conference ran by the University
            which had a workshop that specialized in creating your own game through unity. This little workshop got me infatuated
            with prospect of learning to code which led me to where I am today.
        </p1>

            My favourite passtime would be playing video games because I personally just love being dragged into a well written story
            and experience new adventures. My personal hobby gave me a thought that if I spend a lot of time playing games
            why not learn how to make them myself? This sense of creation and wonder just further enforce the new inspiration
            I have for coding. Although I may spend a lot of time behind my screen that does not mean I don't have other
            things that I love to do in life.

            I have travelled most of Eastern Europe as well as some of the West such as visiting Poland,Hungary,Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia,
            Greece, Italy, Germany, Spain, and France which does not include trips to the United States and latin American
            countries. I guess you could say I am well travelled as I find it important to experience different cultures
            and get a different perspective on life. I also have a preference for spending time biking and hiking during
            the warmer months with my gilfriend who is also quite an outdoors person and I joke with her that the reason
            that I will stay relatively fit is because of her and her love for the outdoors. I am sure there is more that
            I could write about myself but I am going to leave it at this and maybe add some more late.
